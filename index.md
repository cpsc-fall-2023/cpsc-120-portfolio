# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Braedon Collett and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a fun one because I loved working with vectors inside vectors. I learned how to visualize the vector accessing and creation process, and I was even able to teach others how to do the same. I also was able to apply some techniques I learned in ACM algorithim club.
* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a good lab because I loved going in depth with my functions. I loved thinking about edge cases, and considering how the program would behave with different inputs. I had a lot of fun making sure my code was very robust and could handle any input it was given.

* Lab 11

    Lab 10, part 2 was probably my favorite because I had to combine a lot of different aspects to make the project work. I had to mix a lot of different functions and programming tricks, and because everything had to work together perfectly, it required me to think very carefully about how each function interacted with each other.
